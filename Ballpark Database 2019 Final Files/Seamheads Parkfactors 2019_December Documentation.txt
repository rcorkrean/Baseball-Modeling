1.1 Introduction

This database contains batting statistics by ballpark for
Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2019.  It includes data from
the two current leagues (American and National), the four other "major" 
leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and
Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875. 

This database also contains park configuration data by year for each 
major league ballpark used.   This data, however, should be understood
to be based on many reported measurements which may be unreliable and may
conflict with other reported measurements.  Some reported data has been 
corrected via the usage of maps and geometric approximations to make
the data as accurate as possible.

If you have any problems or find any errors, please let me know.  Any 
feedback is appreciated

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2 What's New

2019 December Version data changes (12/14/2019)

The 2019 version now includes 2018, 1906 and 1907 home and away, and LH and RH splits based on
Retrosheet play-by-play and Boxscore data. (note sometimes bathand is unknown for switch-hitters
and for some other batters pre-1926).


Added numerous configuration data updates.

1.4 Using this Database

This version of the database is available in Microsoft Access
format or in a generic, comma delimited format. Because this is a
relational database, you will not be able to use the data in a
flat-database application.


Please note that this is not a stand alone application.  It requires
a database application or some other application designed specifically
to interact with the database.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0 Data Tables

The design follows these general principles.  Each park is assigned a
unique number (ParkID).  All of the information relating to that park 
is tagged with its ParkID.  The ParkIDs are linked to Teams and 
Years in the main data tables.

The database is comprised of the following main tables:

Home Main Data W Park BreakOUT - Runs and Home Runs for Home and Opponent teams for all seasons by Park by Team By Season.
 	Other offensive events (doubles, triples, etc) for the seasons:
 	1906-2018
	1871, 1872, 1874 (NA)

Home Main Data - Runs and Home Runs for Home and Opponent teams for all seasons by Team by Season.
 	Other offensive events (doubles, triples, etc) for the seasons:
 	1906-2018
	1871, 1872, 1874 (NA)

Visitor Main Data - Runs and Home Runs for Visitor and Opponent teams for all seasons by Team By Season.
 	Other offensive events (doubles, triples, etc) for the seasons:
 	1906-2018
	1871, 1872, 1874 (NA)

ParkConfig - Data on descriptive park items such as foul line distances, fence heights, capacities, etc.

It is supplemented by these tables:

RH_LH_Data - Subset of Main Data Tables broken down by LH/RH for most offensive events within H/A for
 years where available (note some years before 1974 incomplete). Box Score Data was used to supplement the data for seasons prior to 1941.

RH_LH_ALL_HR - Home Runs broken down by LH/RH within H/A for all seasons by Team by Season 
(may not match Home Runs in  RH_LH_Data for any years where Retrosheet play by play data is incomplete).  	
	
Parks - Park ID Master Table
Teams - Team ID Master Table
Leagues  - League ID Master Table
LeagueTeams - League/Team Valid Combinations Master Table
Retrosheet_BBDB_Team_Xref - Cross reference of team IDs between Retrosheet and Baseball Databank where different
Park Events - Firsts and Lasts, special events per park for selected historical parks (under construction)
No-Hitters - Firsts and lasts, special events per park (under construction)

Sections 2.1 through 2.9 of this document describe each of the tables in
detail and the fields that each contains.

3.0 Data Issues

RH_LH_Data Table MAY not tie exactly to Home_Main_Data Tables and Visitor_Main_Data in some seasons for all data due to incomplete play by play data in Retrosheet Event Files.

RH_LH_ALL_HR_Only Table home runs MAY not tie exactly to RH_LH_Data table home runs due to incomplete play by play data in Retrosheet Event Files.

LH/RH HR data for 1906 thru 1925 seasons have records marked as "U" for "Unknown" as the handedness of some batters is not known.

LH/RH data for 1906 thru 1936 seasons have records marked as "B" for "switch-hitter, handedness unknown".

If anyone knows where to find the exact numbers for these items, please let me know.

4.0 Online Version of Database

The online database version includes the following additional data:

Map of park location
Percentage calculations by season of Turf and Roof types.
Averages by season of field dimensions, wall heights, fair territory, and backstop distances.
Totals of games by team and by city.


1 Year Park Factors:

The 1 year park factors are based on UNREGRESSED observed data. There is an 'other parks corrector' calculation
made due to the other road parks' total difference from the league average being offset by the park rating
of the park that is being rated. In other words, if you're calculating factors for Coors Field, then Coors itself
is not part of the 'road' set of parks it is being compared against, so that road set of parks is actually
slightly pitcher friendly (assuming Coors is hitter friendly that year) instead of being 100% neutral, so the
'other parks corrector' makes an adjustment for that fact.  Except for the other parks corrector calculation,
the 1-year park factors are simple rates of components per At Bat at home divided by rate of components per AB on the road.


3 Year Park Factors:

The 3 year park factors are REGRESSED, and meant as an estimate of the park's 'true' impact on batting components.
We calculate this factor slightly different from Total Baseball/Baseball-Reference.com (see http://www.baseball-reference.com/about/parkadjust.shtml
for an explanation of that calculation).  For a given park/season, we use the 1-year factor for that park/season plus
the 1-year factor for the PREVIOUS season plus the 1-year factor for the FOLLOWING season.  We weight each based on the
number of home games for each season, but otherwise we weight them equally (we don't add weight to the current season).
Then we regress that number 25% towards that parks' long-term historical factor for that component.  The long-term
historical factor is the sum of all 1-year factors for the history of the park weighted by home games each season.
We believe this gives us a closest possible approximation of the 'true' park factor without adding more complicating
variables such as modifications to park characteristics, new parks in the league, weighting the long term
factor by number of seasons, etc.

For the very first and very last year of a park, since there is no PREVIOUS or FOLLOWING season in those cases, we
chose to use an additional following season (season +2) for the first park year and an additional previous season
(season - 2) in those calculations.  This results in the first TWO seasons and the last TWO seasons of the 3 year
calculations being the same!  What we're saying is that lacking an adjacent season our best guess of the first
and last seasons of a parks existence is the same guess we use for the 2nd season and the next to last season.
If anyone wants to prove that there is a more accurate way to handle these 'end' seasons, we are very open to ideas.
